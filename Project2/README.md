# Project 2

This is the directory for the "Chase It" Project. It includes a 4 wheel skid steer robot modeled after the kickstarter [Scout robot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moorebot/scout-the-tiny-ai-powered-autonomous-mobile-robot-for-home/description). It also includes a maze-like world for it to chase after its white ball.

This project also contains robots referenced as "my_robot" which were a part of the introductory lesson. The robot and the worlds can be swapped out as launch file args.

## Setup

Run `source ./setup.sh` once per session in order to properly connect Gazebo with any local models I'm using.

## Running

Run `make run` to start the world
Run `make chase` to initiate the ball chasing

To see other options, run `make help`
